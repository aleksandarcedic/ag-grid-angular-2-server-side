## **ag-grid with angular 2 and server side pagination (with dropdown for selecting rows per page), sorting, filtering (quickFilter and per column filter)**

### backend done with PHP and MySQL
**put pag.php in your webserver root dir (example /var/www/ ) - don't forget to set your credentials**
**for this example i created `authors` table with 2000 lines of dummy data, you can find sql in file authors.sql**



## IMPORTANT - if anyone were to come across this and maybe try it, have in mind that you need to implement your own backend security, and i'm quite sure tweak code here and there :)
